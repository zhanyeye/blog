###### 选词填空

1. 确定空格所填词性
2. 找出对应词性单词
3. 结合文章意思填空



(首先去找空前面有： 冠词，adj.，代词，to, 情态动词)

+ a/ an/ the/ my/ adj./ some + **n**
+ a/ an/ the/ + **adj.** + n
+ 情态动词(can/ may/ must/ could/ will/ 不定式to ) + **v.(原型)**

    ```
    beginning of an __  -> 名词，单数，元音开头
    ```

升级结构：

+ a/ an / the + **adj. / adv.**  + adj. + n.

+ a/ an/ the + adj. + **adj.** + n.

  ```
  , or a __ different attitude toward its human hosts. ->  adv./adj.
  ```


+ 情态动词(can/ may/ must/ could/ will/ 不定性to) + ___ + do

  (发现情态动词，往后面看一眼，若后面已经有动词原形了，考虑填adv.)

  ```
  ..., but I could hardly __ to know my way around the continent.  -> v.
  I can __ do it. -> adv.
  ```

+ n./pron. + **谓语动词（注意时态）** + n. / pron.
  （如果主语是 it 的话，一定是三单啦！！）

  ```
  i __ you  -> 谓语动词
  the teacher who __ to me.
  ```

+ 主语 + **adv.** + 谓语 + 宾语
  （**句子或短语成分完整的时候考虑副词**）

  ```
  I _never_ do it. -> adv.
  ```

+ be + **adv.** + adj. (作表语)

  ```
  It's _very_ important for me  -> adv.
  ```

+ be + done + **adv.** / (be + **adv** + done)

  ```
  He's hurt _badly_   -> adv.
  He became _confused_  
  ```

+ 关注空格前后有无出现 and / or

  ```
  Good, sound science depends on __, experiments and reasoned methodologies.  -> n.复数
  good science also requires __ understanding, clear explanation and concise presentation.   -> adj.
  suspiciously blemish-free vegetables and __ large chickens piled high in supermarkets. ->  adv. (贬义)
  ```
